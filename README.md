## Download the Meshes

https://cvi2.uni.lu/datasets/

`3DBodyTex.v1` contains the meshes and can be downloaded from the external site linked above. 

The bounding boxes provided by `skin3d` correspond to the <b>high</b> resolution meshes.

## Installation Instructions

To use `skin3d`:

1. Fill out the form to request and download [3DBodyTex.v1](https://cvi2.uni.lu/datasets/)
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/jeremykawahara/skin3d.git`
3. Navigate to the repository: `cd skin3d`
4. Create a new environment using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands): `conda create -n skin3d python=3.7`
5. Activate the environment: `conda activate skin3d`
6. Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Examples

We provide example notebooks to help explain the format of the data.

- [bodytex_annotations_data](https://github.com/jeremykawahara/skin3d_private/blob/main/notebooks/bodytex_annotations_data.ipynb) shows the format of the train, valid, and multiple annotator test data
- [bodytex_longitudinal_data](https://github.com/jeremykawahara/skin3d_private/blob/main/notebooks/bodytex_longitudinal_data.ipynb) shows the format of the IDs used to track the same lesion across scans
- [bodytex_annotations_visual](https://github.com/jeremykawahara/skin3d_private/blob/main/notebooks/bodytex_annotations_visual.ipynb) illustrates how to visualize multiple annotators on a texture image 

## Structure

This repository is structured as follows:

- [data/](https://github.com/jeremykawahara/skin3d_private/tree/main/data) contains the 25,000+ manual lesion annotations for 3DBodyTex
- [notebooks/](https://github.com/jeremykawahara/skin3d_private/tree/main/notebooks) contains example notebooks that load and process the annotations
- [skin3d/](https://github.com/jeremykawahara/skin3d/tree/master/skin3d) contains the Python package to load and process the annotations
